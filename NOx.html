				<h1>Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)</h1>
				<p>Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are gaseous air pollutants which include nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> ). </p>

					<h3>Emission Sources</h3>
					<p>These gases are produced during the combustion (burning) of fossil fuels. Combustion of coal and natural gas in power plants are a major source of NOx.  The transportation sector is also a major source for NOx as a result of combustion of gasoline and diesel in the engines of cars, trucks and buses. NO<sub>2</sub> along with volatile organic compounds (like gasoline) react in the atmosphere to form ozone (O3), another air pollutant.</p>

					<h3>Health Impact</h3>
					<p>â€œNitrogen dioxide causes a range of harmful effects on the lungs, including:
						<ul>
							<li>Increased inflammation of the airways;
							<li>Worsened cough and wheezing;
							<li>Reduced lung function;
							<li>Increased asthma attacks;
							<li>Greater likelihood of emergency department and hospital admissions.
							<li>New research warns that NO2 is likely to be a cause of asthma in children.</p>
						</ul>


				<h3>Ecosystem Impact</h3>
				<p>NOx contribute to acid deposition (rain and snow). Acid deposition is responsible for damaging pristine forests and aquatic ecosystems, including killing of trees and fish and impacting soil quality. NOx emissions also contribute to eutrophication.</p>

					<h3>Regulations</h3>
					<p>In the U.S. the 1970s Clean Air Act (CAA) and subsequent amendments regulate emissions of NOx. As a result of regulations, levels of this air pollutant have on average decreased.</p>
