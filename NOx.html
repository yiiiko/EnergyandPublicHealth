				<h4>Nitrogen Oxide</h4>
				<p>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is one of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of nitrogen or nitrogen oxides (NOx). Other nitrogen oxides include nitrous acid and nitric acid. NO<sub>2</sub> is used as the indicator for the larger group of nitrogen oxides.</p>

					<h5>Health Impact</h5>
					<p>Breathing air with high concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthema, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms. Longer exposures to elevated concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> may contribute to the development of asthma and potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. People with asthma, as well as children and the elderly are generally at greater risk for the health effects of NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

					<h5>Regulation</h5>
					<p>EPA's national and regional rules to reduce emissions of NO<sub>2</sub> and NOx will help state and local governments meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).</p>
					<p>EPA identifies areas where the air quality does not meet the national NO<sub>2</sub> standards. For these areas, state, local, and tribal governments develop plans to reduce the amount of NO<sub>2</sub> in the air.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>NO<sub>2</sub> and other NOx interact with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Acid rain harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests.</li>
						<li>NOx in the atmosphere contributes to nutrient pollution in coastal waters.</li>
						<li>The nitrate particles that result from NOx make the air hazy and difficult to see through. This affects the many national parks that we visit for the view.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<!-- img tag place holder -->
					
					<h5>Pollution Source</h5>
					<p>NO<sub>2</sub> primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. NO<sub>2</sub> forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.</p>
