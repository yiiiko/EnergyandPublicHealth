				<h1>Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</h1>
				<p>Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is a gaseous air pollutant. </p>

					<h3>Emission Sources</h3>
					<p>It is produced during the combustion (burning) of fossil fuels. Combustion of coal in power plants is the primary source of SO<sub>2</sub>. Diesel engines in trucks and buses are also sources of SO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

					<h3>Health Impact</h3>

						<p>“Sulfur dioxide causes a range of harmful effects on the lungs:
							<ul>
								<li>Wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness and other problems, especially during exercise or physical activity.
								<li>Continued exposure at high levels increases respiratory symptoms and reduces the ability of the lungs to function.
								<li>Short exposures to peak levels of SO<sub>2</sub> in the air can make it difficult for people with asthma to breathe when they are active outdoors.
								<li>Rapid breathing during exercise helps SO2 reach the lower respiratory tract, as does breathing through the mouth.
								<li>Increased risk of hospital admissions or emergency room visits, especially among children, older adults and people with asthma.”
							</ul>
							</p>



				<h3>Ecosystem Impact</h3>
				<p>SO<sub>2</sub> contributes to acid deposition (rain and snow). Acid deposition is responsible for damaging pristine forests and aquatic ecosystems, including killing of trees and fish and impacting soil quality.</p>

					<h3>Regulations</h3>
					<p>In the U.S. the 1970s Clean Air Act (CAA) and subsequent amendments regulate emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>. As a result of regulations, levels of this air pollutant have on average decreased.
