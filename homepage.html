		    <p> <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/outdoor/air-pollution/" target="_blank">Breathing in </a> air pollutants impact our respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems. Studies indicate that almost <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/may/17/air-pollution-may-be-damaging-every-organ-and-cell-in-the-body-finds-global-review" target="_blank">every organ in our bodies can be impacted by air pollution</a>.  In 2013, the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> classified air pollutants as carcinogenic to humans.
Air pollutants are responsible for acid deposition which impact ecosystems and damage to infrastructure. Air pollutants also weaken the immune systems of plants and animals and lower agricultural productivity.

					<center><h3>Hidden Cost of Energy: Air Pollutants and GHGs</h3></center>
						<p>Economists monetize the health and environmental impacts of emissions of air pollutants and GHGs from power plants as an external cost. The external cost is the “hidden” cost of the electricity we use in our homes, schools, businesses as this cost is not reflected in what we pay for in our electricity bills. </p>
						<p>This external cost results from the impacts of air pollution and climate change such as hospital bills, pay loss due to sick days, emergency room visits, higher death rates, extreme weather events, loss of agriculture from drought, and loss of property from wildfires. This external cost is a cost borne by society and so is also considered a “social” cost often paid for from our taxes.</p>
						<p>These “costs” could be shifted towards “savings” by transitioning towards “cleaner” energy sources. Money saved by lower health costs, less damage from hurricanes, wildfires, and sea level rise could be used to invest in cleaner energy sources, education, healthcare, etc.</p>

						<p class = "round">Q: What are the hidden costs of the energy sources used to generate electricity for your city or state? How can these “costs” be shifted towards “savings”?</p>
