					<center><h3>Hidden Cost of Energy: Air Pollutants and GHGs</h3></center>
						<p>Economists monetize the health and environmental impacts of emissions of air pollutants and GHGs from power plants as an external cost. The external cost is the “hidden” cost of the electricity we use in our homes, schools, businesses as this cost is not reflected in what we pay for in our electricity bills. </p>
						<p>This external cost results from the impacts of air pollution and climate change such as hospital bills, pay loss due to sick days, emergency room visits, higher death rates, extreme weather events, loss of agriculture from drought, and loss of property from wildfires. This external cost is a cost borne by society and so is also considered a “social” cost often paid for from our taxes.</p>
						<p>These “costs” could be shifted towards “savings” by transitioning towards “cleaner” energy sources. Money saved by lower health costs, less damage from hurricanes, wildfires, and sea level rise could be used to invest in cleaner energy sources, education, healthcare, etc.</p>

Cities in states like <a href = "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/24/air-pollution-smog-soot-worst-california/3551734002/" target="_blank">California</a> and
					<a href = "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Despite-progress-Houston-air-quality-among-worst-13791574.php" target="_blank">Texas</a> still struggle with smog. <br>
					It is also important to note that while levels of air pollutants have decreased because of the Clean Air Act, levels of GHGs have not declined. Some states have <a href = "https://www.c2es.org/content/state-climate-policy/" target="_blank">adopted targets</a> to reduce emissions of GHGs.
				<br>Imagine if there are federal limits to emissions of GHGs. How much more money could be saved by lowering the external costs of GHG emissions? </p>

				<p class = "round">Are the “cost” of regulations higher than the “benefits”?</p>
				</div>
				<p>Environmental regulations are often presented as being expensive and questions raised as to whether or not the "benefits" of regulations outweigh the "costs". In the case of the CAA the answer is clear - the benefits far outweigh the costs. And the beneficiaries are the people who reside in the U.S as a result of breathing cleaner air.</p>
				<p>Since the passing of the 1970 CAA and amendments, the air quality in the U.S. has improved, significantly lowering the external cost . Some studies suggest for every $1 invested in regulations to improve air quality, $40 was returned to the U.S. economy, saving trillions of dollars since the passing of the Clean Air Act in 1970.
