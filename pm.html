				<h1>Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>)</h1>
				<p>“Particulate matter contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, also known as fine particles or PM2.5, pose the greatest risk to health.” <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics" target="_blank">EPA </a></p>

					<h3>Health Impact</h3>

						<p>“Particle pollution can be very dangerous to breathe depending on the level. Breathing particle pollution may trigger illness, hospitalization and premature death.”
							“Anyone who lives where particle pollution levels are high is at risk. Some people face higher risk, however. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:
							Infants, children and teens;
							<ul>
							<li>People over 65 years of age;
							<li>People with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;
							<li>People with heart disease or diabetes;
							<li>People who work or are active outdoors.
							<li>Diabetics face increased risk at least in part because of their higher risk for cardiovascular disease.
							<li>People with lung cancer also appear to be at higher risk from particle pollution”

					<h3>Regulations</h3>
					<p>In the U.S, the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) and subsequent amendments regulate emissions of PM. As a result of regulations, levels of this air pollutant have on average decreased.
