					<p>Carbon dioxide has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Emission of carbon dioxide from combustion of fossil fuels (coal, methane, gasoline, diesel) for electricity and transportation are by far the largest source of this GHG.</p>
					<!-- img tag -->
					<h3>Health Impact</h3>
					<p>Being a GHG, rising levels of CO2 contributes to a warmer Earth. A warmer Earth drives climate change. The impact of climate change varies for different geographic locations. Impacts include much hotter summers causing increasing mortality rates due to heat strokes, changes in disease vectors, poorer air quality as warmer temperatures increase the formation of ozone, lower agricultural productivity, and water and food stress.
					</p>

				<h3>Ecosystem Impact</h3>
				<p>Rising sea levels, warmer temperatures, changes in disease vectors, forest fires, water and food related stress impact all life on Earth. A recent U.N. report revealed that a million species are in danger of extinction with climate change being a major driver. </p>

					<h3>Regulations</h3>
					<p>In 2015, 185 nations signed the Paris Agreement to lower emissions of GHGs. In 2017, President Trump withdrew the U.S. support of the Paris Accord. In spite of this, some states in the US have committed to lower emissions of GHGs.</p>
