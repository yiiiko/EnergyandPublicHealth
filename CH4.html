				<h1>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</h1>
				<p>Methane is an odorless, colorless, greenhouse gas. It is the dominant component of natural gas. On a per molecule basis, methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. </p>

					<h3>Emission Sources</h3>
					<p>Methane has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Methane as natural gas is used in power plants for electricity generation and in homes, schools, businesses for heat and cooking. Methane is also released by agriculture and livestock.</p>

					<h3>Health Impact</h3>

						<p>Being a GHG, rising levels of CH<sub>4</sub> contributes to a warmer Earth. A warmer Earth drives climate change. The impact of climate change varies for different geographic locations. Impacts include much hotter summers causing increasing mortality rates due to heat strokes, changes in disease vectors, poorer air quality as warmer temperatures increase the formation of ozone, lower agricultural productivity, and water and food stress.</p>



				<h3>Ecosystem Impact</h3>
				<p>Rising sea levels, warmer temperatures, changes in disease vectors, forest fires, water and food related stress impact all life on Earth. A recent U.N. report revealed that a million species are in danger of extinction with climate change being a major driver.</p>

					<h3>Regulations</h3>
					<p>In 2015, 185 nations signed the Paris Agreement to lower emissions of GHGs. In 2017, President Trump withdrew the U.S. support of the Paris Accord. In spite of this, some states in the US have committed to lower emissions of GHGs.</p>
